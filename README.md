# RFID Reader Project

This project consists of using a Wiegand RFID Panel to activate and deactivate my alarm in home-assistant. What it does is, it will read from the panel and sent the pin over mqtt to home-assistant. There it will be evaluated and if correct it will deactivate (or activate) the alarm.
